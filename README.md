# school
I started this repos during my time studying Game Development in Digital Arts and Entertainment (DAE) in Kortrijk (Belgium)

Most of this repos contains excercises and content related to the subjects Programming 1-4 but it also contains some personal projects.
To view other, more specific projects, look at my other repos.

Even though Github says that most of it is in C, the code I've written is in C++. A big part of the framework that we received from the school is in C.
For other aspiring Game Devs or other students, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter (@Wardergrip) or Discord (Wardergrip#1263).
