# school
All my work I have done during my time studying Game Development in Digital Arts and Entertainment (DAE) in Kortrijk (Belgium)

Even though Github says that most of it is in C, the code I've written is in C++. A big part of the framework that we received from the school is in C.
For other aspiring Game Devs or other students, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter (@Wardergrip) or Discord (Wardergrip#1263).
